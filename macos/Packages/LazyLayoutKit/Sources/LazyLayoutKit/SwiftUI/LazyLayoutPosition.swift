/// ```swift
/// @State private var position = LazyLayoutPosition<Photo.ID>()
///
/// var body: some View {
///     LazyLayoutView(photos, layout: JustifiedLayout(), position: $position) { photo in
///         .aspectRatio(photo.aspectRatio)
///     } content: { photo in
///         PhotoCell(photo)
///     }
///     .toolbar {
///         Button("Latest") { position.scrollTo(id: photos[0].id, anchor: .center) }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Why this is not SwiftUI's `ScrollPosition`
///
/// `ScrollPosition`'s id targeting finds the *view* with that identity. In a
/// virtualized container the item you want to reach usually has no view — that is
/// the entire point — so there is nothing for it to find. This resolves the id
/// through the layout instead: ``LayoutSnapshot/frame(of:)`` gives the item's
/// geometry, computed long before any view existed, and
/// ``LayoutSnapshot/offset(toShow:anchor:viewportHeight:currentOffset:)->Double?`` turns
/// that into a scroll offset. Jumping to item 900,000 costs one identity scan.
///
/// ## A request is not a record of where the user is
///
/// This carries requests *to* the container and never reads anything back, so the
/// target it holds is the last thing you asked for — not where the collection
/// actually ended up. The moment the user scrolls, the two diverge, and nothing
/// here notices.
///
/// That is what separates it from SwiftUI's `ScrollPosition`, which updates its
/// `viewID` as the user scrolls and so can genuinely restore a position. This
/// cannot, and does not try to.
///
/// It follows that a stale target must not be re-applied. Servicing a request
/// does not clear it — the container records which token it handled rather than
/// writing back through your binding — so a container created fresh against a
/// long-used position would otherwise jump to whatever was last asked for, which
/// by then is very likely nowhere near where the user was. Containers therefore
/// **ignore any request minted before they existed**, and act only on ones made
/// while they were alive.
///
/// To have a *new* container open at an item, say so explicitly with
/// ``init(initiallyScrolledTo:anchor:)``. That is the one form a container will
/// honour at birth, and it is spent once honoured — so it opens the collection,
/// it does not keep dragging the user back there.
///
/// ## What it does not do in 0.3
///
/// This is a write-only handle: it carries requests to the container and reports
/// nothing back. There is no `isScrollPending` and no "which item is on screen".
/// Both would mean the container writing through your binding, which invalidates
/// your view and re-runs the container's initializer — O(n) in the collection —
/// and it would do so while the user is scrolling. Read-back needs a design that
/// does not sit on that path.
///
/// Programmatic scrolls are immediate by default. Callers can opt into animation;
/// the container follows intermediate viewports to keep their cells materialized.

    ///   value would ignore the second tap — exactly the case where the user has
    ///   scrolled away and wants to go back.
    /// - A *replaced* position fires. The token is drawn from a process-wide
    ///   counter rather than one per instance, so a brand new position cannot
    ///   accidentally present a value the container has already serviced.
    /// - A *stale* request does not fire. Because the counter is monotonic, a
    ///   container that recorded the highest token at its own birth can tell a
